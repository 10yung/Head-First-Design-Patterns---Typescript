# Head First Design Patterns in TypeScript
A TypeScript implementation of each chapter example in the Head First Design Patterns book.

## Getting Started
`yarn install`

### Compile files in `src` of each chapter
Go to the `[Chapter-Name]/src` folder and enter `gulp` in your terminal. `gulp` will automatically compile all `ts` files to `./dist` folder.

### See the result of each example code
Go to the `[Chapter-Name]/dist` folder and enter `node index.js` to execute the index file. The result will print out in your terminal.
